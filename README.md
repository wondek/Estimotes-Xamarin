The Java binding for [Estimotes SDK for Android](https://github.com/Estimote/Android-SDK) has been relocated to a new home along with a bunch of other Xamarin.Android binding libraries.

To install the component, it's easiest to install the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Estimotes-Xamarin/) into your Xamarin.Android project.
